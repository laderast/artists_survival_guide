# Introduction

To make art in the world is difficult. Making art in an indifferent world, when you have a small audience, is even more difficult.

This book consists of essays written from 2015 to 2020 about how to continue to make art in an indifferent world. They were mostly previously published on my blog: [15 People](https://15people.net). Hopefully you will find these essays helpful as you continue on in your artistic journey.

## About Me

I am a [Musician](https://15people.net), a [Data scientist](https://laderast.github.io) and an [Educator](https://laderast.github.io/cv). I have a pretty unique view of making art. 

Why should you listen to me? I have been making music and art in some form for over 28 years. I don't consider myself to be wildly successful, but I have managed to continue making art in some form or other, and I consider that mildly successful.

I have a number of releases and music and more information is available here: https://15people.net/music/. 

## One Note

Note it is called *an* Artist's Survival Guide, not *the* Artist's Survival Guide. As you continue in your artistic career, you will need to develop your own strategies to survive.
