# Introduction

To make art in the world is difficult. Making art in an indifferent world, when you have a small audience, is even more difficult.

This book consists of essays written from 2015 to 2020 about how to continue to make art in an indifferent world. Hopefully you will find it helpful as you continue on in your journey.

## One Note

Note it is called *an* Artist's Survival Guide, not *the* Artist's Survival Guide. As you continue in your artistic career, you will need to develop your own strategies to survive.
